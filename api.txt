The RBAC API
############

We should use an RBAC authorization system with each role as an API resource containing a set of regex permissions to recognize strings encoded from (method, uri) tuples.

In order to achieve both route and resource-level RBAC, all write endpoints (POST, PUT and DELETE) should receive all resources to be written through the URI.

In this model, permissions to manage a sub-resource may be inherited from permissions to manage the parent resource.

Also, role endpoints following the sub-resource style may be helpful to provide fine-grained RBAC.

### Example 1
route: PUT /contests/:contestPublicID/printtasks/:taskPublicID
regex: PUT/contests/my-contest/printtasks/* (could be inside the role my-contest-staff)

### Example 2
route 1: PUT /contests/:contestPublicID/solutions/:solutionPublicID
route 2: PUT /contests/:contestPublicID/solutions/:solutionPublicID/executions/:executionPublicID
regex: PUT/contests/my-contest/solutions/* (could be inside the role my-contest-judge)
